# Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation

This project contains the implementation of an image processing algorithm for retinal blood vessel segmentation. The algorithm utilizes various image processing techniques including contrast enhancement, morphological operations, and custom thresholding to extract blood vessels from retinal images.

### Prerequisites

The code is written in MATLAB, and thus MATLAB is required to run it. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
The same scripts are working in python, with the equalivalent functions
